Hi there.
I'm @FBQuail, and I'm a novice that just picked up coding as a hobby

I don't have any plans; I just do whatever I feel like doing.

I've made a discord bot, which I'll come back to eventually.

As of right now, I'm working on a website for myself and my "brand".
I also ocassionally help out others with their websites
