Hi there.
I'm @hydroxism, and I'm a novice that just picked up coding as a hobby

I don't have any plans; I just do whatever I feel like doing.

The current project I'm spending most of my time on is my discord bot named "kassbot".
I'll use this site to collaborate with friends on projects like kass and any others that I join.
